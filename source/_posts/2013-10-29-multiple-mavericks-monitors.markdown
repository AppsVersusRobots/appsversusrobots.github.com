When OSX Mavericks, was announced, I was excited about the multiple monitor support. 
Now that it is [here][1], I'm even more! I've long used two monitors for development and 
the changes put into Mavericks fit right into my workflow.

### Monitors and Spaces
Even before I used a Mac (there was a time), I utilized virtual desktops on both Linux and
Windows. I find that compartmentalizing my work environments helps me stay productive.
One space for social items (AIM, Twitter, IRC, Email), one for development, 
and another for "random" i.e. web browsing and word/excel type things. Once I moved to 
Mac, I quickly learned of [Spaces][2] and adapted it into my workflow. I use the 
keyboard shortcuts for direct space access, along with the track pad gestures (4-finger
swipe) to quickly switch between spaces.

My pre-Mavericks setup had all of my social items and web browser on space 1, XCode and 
iPhone simulator on space 2, and BBEdit and iTerm on space 3. Everything was fine
and I kept focus until an IM or IRC message came in. Then I would switch to space 1 to reply
and lose track of what I was doing. Enter Mavericks. With Mavericks, I can designate my
second monitor as a completely separate space. While this doesn't sound like a big deal,
it is. Because the monitor is its own space, changing spaces on my primary monitor via 
gesture leaves the other monitor's space alone. That means I can switch between XCode 
and BBEdit spaces while never losing my communications apps on the secondary. It also means 
that I don't notice a new article in [feedly][3] while replying to an IM. I also really 
like that the dock will move to whatever monitor you want it to, as well as the
menu bar being available on both.

### Current Setup
While this is always an evolution, here is my current setup:

	*	Space 1 (Primary Monitor): Chrome, Skype, Mail.app, Outlook, Spotify
	*	Space 2 (Primary Monitor): XCode, iOS Simulator, Sourcetree, Dash
	*	Space 3 (Primary Monitor): BBEdit, iTerm, Sequel Pro
	*	Space 4 (Secondary): Messages, Twitterific, Textual
	
### Help
One minor thing that I can't seem to track down, but if you know please inform me: when 
disconnecting the secondary monitor, I'd like the "space 4" apps to stay in their own
space vs merging with "space 1". If there is some way to do so, [@adamweeks][4].
