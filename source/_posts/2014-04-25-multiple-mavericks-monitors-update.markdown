Previously, I had ended my ["Multiple Mavericks Monitors"][1] discussion with the
question of:
>One minor thing that I can't seem to track down, but if you know please inform me: when
disconnecting the secondary monitor, I'd like the "space 4" apps to stay in their own
space vs merging with "space 1".

I finally had the light bulb go off after sticking with
my setup: "move everything over!"

Back to my [original post][1] on this topic, if you just "++" all of the spaces
numbers, you will now have my current setup. This leaves "space 1" empty.
'Why would you want an empty space?', you might ask. That is because when you
disconnect your external monitor, the "space 4" that was merging with "space 1"
now will simply merge with an empty space. When you plug the external monitor
back in, everything in that space moves back to where it was!

Now I just have to retrain myself to use the ^+2 key command to switch
to my "email" space!
